# README
To get this up and running, make sure to follow these steps:
* Clone this repository recursively to also checkout the submodules
* Create a `fonts` directory at the root of this repository and put the font you want to finetune inside
* Create a `data` directory inside the `tesstrain` directory
* Open the Jupyter notebook and read it carefully. Make adjustments where needed.

### Note:
This was originally used to train a model to reliably recognize the slashed zeros of the "Consolas" font. They were almost always mixed up with 6's, 8's or 9's. You may use this for any kind of finetuning though.
